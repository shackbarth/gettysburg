# The Gettysburg Sequence
### This previously unpublished work was written by American poet Carl Franck, alias Mike Quill, from 1971-1972.


### Proem
#####(July 1 - 2 - 3, 1863)

Numbers blur; there's a lie under them, in the teeth of an [old saw](#Old Saw). By Armistice Day in New England, [rock maples](#Rock Maple), one by one, stand skeletons; their erstwhile blaze waits out wind or broom-rake unto oblivion. A leaf, overtaken of a breezeless forenoon, poses, slips, and glides see-saw turfward. It billets you or me.

Legion undone, tallysome though, pocked the meadows, bogs, and bosks roundabout the nodding town of tanners, cobblers, and saddlers. Why Gettysburg? Well, because Brigadier Johnston Pettigrew of Major General Harry [Heth's](#Heth) Division, attached to Lieutenant General Ambrose Powell Hill's III Corps, in General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia fancied shoes -- not just for himself. He besought, properly enough, the General's go-ahead; Heth, eschewing channels, assented. Such seeming-unfraught whim committed Mr. Davis, 180 mile distant their shopping spree. Said coy contract, bodeing more than it chattered, Major General John F. [Reynolds](#Reynolds), I Corps, Army of The Potomac, counter-signed instanter. The fee came a small fortune though... himself's mortality, ninety seconds upon arrival the Union defense line tight Willoughby Run. A Mississippi marksman, discerning an epaulet, undid one highly competent Pennsylvania soldierman. Just like that. Pettigrew horned assorted foot-gear all right, Heth wore an hole in the soul, Longstreet didn't quite fit, Lee was saddled to the wrong mount.

Thomas Jonathan Jackson did not attend; John Buford did. J. E. B. Stuart shew tardy; John Buford was waiting, astraddle.

Mr. Hemingway has scrawled the hippocratic arithmetic sufficeing terse for Quill: "The valid statistic is one (1)." Only moons back, [Johnny and Jack](#Johnny and Jack) graced their respective kitchens: worrying pigloins at Roanoke, brine-beef at Chelsea; swilling cider, cameling porter; gameing their women in oestrus. Now, one at a time, find Johnny Frye, tag Jack Prendergast. Never. That be absolute, Dr. Einstein or no.

Women (chaste or riggish, what matter?), waiting remote the cauldron, made do, got by on wintersleep, and aged. Still: spank kitchen, groom [bairns](#Bairn) to school, swab baby's bum and promise. Who's to undertake pronunciamentos? Where quaysi Death puts up, calipres and stethescopes count nothing.

Time near hand, Quill abode hardby Dublin and Edinburgh. At Solomonic fingering he assays matrices and castings treasure thereabout. The apposite styles graze, they don't bump. Dublin, nimble, [Swiftian](#Swiftian); Edinburgh, painstaking, [Smithlike](#Smithlike). Wharfing a sentient sea-farer, Yank at that, they grimaced, but jettisoned a few entries in the tired log. In keeping, the clans lent him sporadic ingress their pow-wows. If he sorted traits and tics; if he turned [bias](#Bias) along the potter-wheels weather, terrain, pinch or groaning board; if he reckoned incongruities back to tamper-mechanics of dispossession and out-breeding under the [pounces](#Pounces) and genitalia of successive usurpers, he was at least talking Celt turkey. And because he buttressed his surmise, often as not ever needing utterance, with a goodly smattering of either island's overt and/or clandestine scrapes along history -- surges and setbacks -- Mac's and O's came sluggish to trust him, within bounds... as it should be.

All right, so much for west-east. East-west? Another yarn. Quill winced, at times, that so witted islanders as Celts proved out so lethargic, stony, when the mere matter pertained The United States of Purgatory, panaorama of Paradise, large scale chart of Gehanna. There's more than one irish bank vice-president who can put finger on G. Washington, taps grand excitement gawking General Custer, Sitting Bull rendezvous at the [Telly](#Telly), or imparts the arcane lore that Kennedys hearthed County Wexford whilst Fitzgeralds sprang The West. Midlothian solicitors abound who revere Alexander Graham Bell, envy Uncle Same manna because Dr. Albert Einstein turned up abandoned at his door-sill, confide their nation bestowed on General Eisenhower a castle with moat... and golf course. Abigail Adams? "Sorra, you'll need to explicate." (Jaysusgod, and She statured thrice the woman Mary Stuart dreamt upstairs or craved below.) To be sure, Quill, by bent, seldom haunted the academic, bohemian, or clerical ring-around-the-rosy cabals. He muscled his milieu on men-in-commerce, builder-architects, the Military, their wives and/or lemans that tagged along, drunks threatening give-and-take, publicans who slaked them. But still.

Stateside? Same poor show, less amnesty Quill's stricture. The germane verb spells no longer wince; it scans scorn on peers his age or less or more, and some scope wider far. No moral indictment. Nastier: sluggard stance, unstyle. Desuetude yawns for Taps? A balm, an easement, [nemine gratia](#Nemine Gratia), and [instant gentlemen](#Instant Gentlemen) won't stand attention its Benison once a night, once a death, once a nation? Hale, drones of necropolis! New Bedford blood, Front Royal lymph, spilt all right, stains not your tufted wall-to-wall carpeting. Your Martini runneth over, Sir.

Just so. Rancour prompted the fourteen poems; humbleness before sustained them, such as they be. (Small fibbings? Well, a Kerryman will squander ninety-nine lies to get one fact across.) What burthen they lug? Patently into middle age, he would now decrypt the lode into Quillese, then chance the effluvia at the alter of Merciless Mother English. As he's stared and mulled downside The Angle hardby the clump of trees, between the Codori cote and barn, across the Emmitsburg road, past The Swale, into Spangler's Wood he partly pieces together, like a [dhobi](#Dhobi) gathering remnants of a shattered crock and hopelessly findering them, how he, you, and the yearling nation died... and under whose auspices:

- [Abraham Lincoln](#the-gettysburg-sequence-1)
- [Robert E. Lee](#the-gettysburg-sequence-2)
- Traveller
- [John Burns](#the-gettysburg-sequence-3)
- [Jennie Wren](#the-gettysburg-sequence-4)
- [Henry Lee](#the-gettysburg-sequence-5)
- [George Meade](#the-gettysburg-sequence-6)
- [Arno Kiesewetter](#the-gettysburg-sequence-7)
- [Father Corby](#the-gettysburg-sequence-8)
- [John Sedgewick](#the-gettysburg-sequence-9)
- [Lewis Armistead](#the-gettysburg-sequence-10)
- [Ian Farquharson](#the-gettysburg-sequence-11)
- [Ulysses S. Grant](#the-gettysburg-sequence-13)
- [Sarah Carter](#the-gettysburg-sequence-14)

Tattoo... Taps. Eyes dry, sweep down Glory's roster again for Domesday's sake. Go ahead, murmur: "But Glory shew on and on -- Wake Island, Bastogne, Tarawa, Huertgen Forest." Other times, other Glories: Glories of stock, Glories in season. Glory of the maples, October's afternoon; Glorious the seared beech, defying December to undress first. Twin Glories: Gettysburg, Guadalcanal... The Glory of life passing into death, the Glory of death passing for life.

Mr. Yeats blasphemed shrewd when he owned up that Sex and Death loomed the two contingencies bloody well worth his bother. Aye, Mr. Yeats. Still, you stem County Sligo gentry; Mike Quill, maker of these sonnets, [septs](#Septs) The [O'Suileabhain](#O'Suileabhain) Kerry fisherfolk. His leaning? Deserving the japer; sex, death, god, pieces o' eight, booze, power. Perhaps he can move on, one day, along more indigenous vein. For now, sex and death. War? Not quite. Gettysburg sums them one.

#####Epilogue  
#####(The Gesture Day... November 19, 1863)

Mr. Lincoln catnaps to the anodynous clacking of his [Reading](#Reading) coach, closeing on Gettysburg. He tallies random inward and outward accounts. Does the President graze you a mite sorry for Abe? Well, does not the Son of Man for Jesus, urgeing a gibbet to its ordained rearing?

>Cuckolded Pa, Ma whelped Abe hedgerow snatch?  
>Mary hugs light to shadow black [Xantipp'](#Xantipp'),  
>The moot-to-matter boys -- his kitchen ketch.  
>Least, [dirksome](#Dirksome) friends! He bodes Knight _Lee_ dark trip.  
>(_He's_ sound: one county's brim each man will stand).  
>Not his, because he loved [Westmoreland](#Westmoreland) more  
>Than [Lincoln's shire](#Lincoln's Shire). Chill God, he's seared a brand  
>Aswash all History that's hapt... foul sore,  
>Ubiquitous as syphilis. To post?  
>Mere _Lee_. _He's_ up to Grant and with his two friends.  
>The sun arcs plane: Abe's sapped, cert as thug Frost  
>Had caned his pipes. Celled pate but turnkey tends.  
>Abe, sugar-plumb the folks. They yearn a fruit.  
>[Sangamon](#Sangamon) mockingbird, he tends thy flute.

### The Gettysburg Sequence #2
#####(The First Day... July 1, 1863)

Robert E. Lee ambles Traveller. The Engineer talks shop and saddle with his sentient engine. The colloquy courses tacit, muted.

Neat, [anabolism](#Anabolism), nibble at the man's fibre... and compounded, two of those three precarious days, by an acute [flux](#Flux); DUTY, as in the past, reports to headquarters. But where intransient ordeal lies doggo to haze, the General will henceforth be taxed over and beyond ITS call. Overload chose noon to weigh in.

Lee speaks:

"Now, no choice but maul the hour. This day? Well, common-sense has written Jackson off. But Stuart? Carlisle's an healthy canter, fetch yesterday. That can abide the [exemplars-to-come](#Exemplars) at West Point... or [Lexington](#Lexington).

First the mete, Brevet Lieutenant Lee: erase Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville -- too lucky, too much Stonewall... and [postures upended](#Postures Upended). (What's more, [Old Whiskers and Fightin' Joe](#Old Whiskers) patently liveried us those twin gory aliments.) Today's algebra? Meade + Sedgewick + stores - Jackson (Have I discounted Stonewall, in truth?), compounded to an escaped power by Stuart = Lee over x. Moot mathematic. And if the tangency disjoin with no [apodosis](#Apodosis)? Well then, Alexander's dread! For five mountain spines and four rivers to west and south, Mr. Lincoln stays his hand with one ace and two jacks showing, and something in the hole. Capt. Lee knows his hand: two kinds showing."

Withal, a good man plumb purest to the Traveller, or [Rover](#Rover), that matches his master... body, heart, and brain.

>I heed [The Snapper](#Snapper), h'm, [Monterey](#Monterey) it was.  
>He miened moot rusy, surfeit stanch. I think,  
>Tight score, we'll squeeze him though. He never does  
>Much quake... less foray 'field. An I claw drink  
>Swish Grant to west (God wits Lee patent can't.)  
>I'd [sough](#Sough) things out the stretch. Or had I had  
>Light Horse spell gadding Jeb, [his](#Light Horse) stores could scant.  
>How deem y' Traveller? Lee's wrought, he's glad,  
>His other self, to mount your splendid side.  
>Since Stonewall fell, y've not once stumbled gait --  
>My trove, trade Jackson's loss. Rain friend, my pride  
>That our [Westmoreland](#Westmoreland) foal the steady trait.  
>I mull Hill, Longstreet, Ewel... puzzles three;  
>I grope: they're mine to fumble with as key.

### The Gettysburg Sequence #3
#####(The First Day... July 1, 1863)

Auld John Burns, [souter](#Souter), stands ready, wheat to the midriff, sighting west.

>Och, three-score-ten o'rifled, tendin' me!  
>I ken grey gooshin' doon yon green defile  
>I'll size the [pownied](#Pownied) [ghaistie](#Ghaistie), Lee, [th' day](#Th' Day)

>He kep', where [Sassunach](#Sassunach) fronts ither shame --  
>Fu' wa' that looms until this awfu' day.  
>'Side me, wee Kerkimer, whose tacit fame  
>Be water he will [tak](#Tak) bricht lad who dee

### The Gettysburg Sequence #4
#####(The First Night... July 1, 1863)

[Jennie Wren](#Jennie Wren) reckons ahead. Penelope's story meanders back to woman on earth: by way of The Wife of Bath, Jennie Wren, till Mollie Bloom. It's the way things sort. The fable comes out silly only cecause of the prisses who have laundered it. [When 'Omer smote 'is bloomin' lyre](#When 'Omer), and tacked his lays through the villages and by-ways of Attica, the locals sensed which cheek his tongue lodged. And blind or not blind, we daresay he knew to wink too.

>Grey gun-butt warns that door; I'll chance him through.  
>Then ream and drain his rifle ball and bore.  
>Johnny minds learn if Jack, or stores, or brew  
>Sequestered by me be. But ere cocks chore  
>[He'll blew](#He'll Blew) his booty Jennie's thighs. Jen rut  
>It so. Peaskins, he'll fret Jen's Jack worked west  
>With little [Phil](#Sheridan). I'll bathe her dusty cut  
>His early dew. Last, like a tot, He'll breast.  
>Sleep after wet, what rude rehearsal death!  
>That man of cloth, The Reverend Herman Kraus,  
>Mumbling bedside, shrives shy, matched spent man's breath.  
>In lieu cold Jack, close Johnny warms this house.  
>'Tis sheets north-south... Sunrise, I'll carve him bread.  
>Go gaze men die, weep once, and get me dead.

---------------------------------

### The Gettysburg Sequence #5
#####(The First Night... July 1, 1863)

Mounted on a sorrel mare, Major [Henry Lee](#Light Horse) reins up along the bedstead in the Lutheran Seminary, Army Headquarters, where his son Robert tussles sleep. (Or do we deem, through an hindsight bestowed, that the Janus-faced prophets, Monk Mendel and Doctor Freud, are honoured once again?)

J. E. B. Stuart's portentious nowhereaboutness has wrought its hobble - the black wool nightmares are woven with. Come daysight, the unfact, the Jeb Stuart fact, roils Robert E. Lee as an _almost_ rational drain on his dwindled neural reserve.

O, the splendid [Anne Carter Lee](#Anne Carter Lee)... a woman to the banner born!

>Exemplar lad, we wit too well _whose_ loin  
>Spasmed that wine-drenched dawn. His shun-hearth wit-  
>Loose vagary slid stallion, doxie, coin.  
>Addlest? Deportment face four kid, twa teat:  
>One ewe to succor ye... whilst blunting ram.  
>That you crag shadeing Launcelot matched men -  
>Broad men that wait - I charge yourself, by damn,  
>And me, false-minting sire, that blades you MAN.  
>Let's sit with hourse. (I've pinked red-coats _that_ trade.)  
>Eschew the equine touch and sleep. Spry Jeb,  
>This hour, creaks springs astraddle [Madelaide](#Madelaide)  
>Nigh [Frizzleburg](#Frizzleburg). ('Nent _mounts_, 'twere tensile web  
>_Their_ Buford wove to tip brim to past day.)  
>Blood Carter rinse your brain. Lord, lave Lee's stay.

---------------------------------

### The Gettysburg Sequence #6
#####(The Second Day... July 2, 1863)

George Gordon Meade strives to be honest with himself and, in his way, toward James Longstreet. He gets up. Dressed to the waist, the General lumbers forth his croft to surprise the sun signalling farside [Red Lion](#Red Lion). This natural spectacle uneases him. He has a _lease_ on the high ground all right, but as celestial prodigies rise, so men have been known to. The man downs his draught of dawn. He repairs to Headquarters, gets gearing behind him, and knuckles down to work. His plotting and placements will resolve in no blameworthy miscalculation. It would take through tomorrow, _owning_ the high ground.

>All right now, Longstreet, lob your dicey hatch.  
>Bollox, trust Meade to botch:-we're merely men,  
>Hence man galore will stand, drop, die to match  
>Our fallibility at noon. Well then?  
>Assault! Mind now, George Meade attends your [best](#Best and Blest);  
>Gone Sundown One, you've skies to squander troops.  
>We falcon high; climb glaze the glint. Lee's [blest](#Best and Blest)  
>May not be up to it so soon. Abe's groups,  
>As his, span downy jowl till patriarch;  
>Twixt them, those pent coitus pends or oils  
>The handy firelock. Approach, absorb its dark  
>Delerium as Eve where Adam soils.  
>The hunter's hunted this 'capade. I'm glad  
>Grey Stonewall's down. Mine's up. Still that thralls sad.

---------------------------------

### The Gettysburg Sequence #7
#####(The Second Day... July 2, 1863)

Major Arno Kiesewetter, Regimental Executive Officer to the 1st Wisconsin Infantry, with ninety minutes tenure - thanks Lt. Col. Aiden's trifty passing by decapitation - lies unattended, dying in The Wheatfield. It doesn't matter though; he's dead, _clinically_. Piffle such a _polysyllabic_, evoking an alabaster haven-of-succour that The Wheatfield manifestly was _not_ July 2, 1863. An encephalographic gadgetry, at our later time, is said to ticker back life-after-death. Once breath and beat have frozen stone cold dead at the market-place, the dwindling oxygen harvest stacked in the cranial silo drags matters out timeable seconds, even minutes, savantry contends.

Arno Kiesewetter was born at Koenigsburg, East Prussia on July 3, 1833. His home, neither outscale the family nor overdone as to trappings, was nonetheless dubbed [SAENGERSCHLOSS](#Saengerschloss). His father, Ulric Kiesewetter, prospered as a cutler, purveying to Junkers and a few well-off Jewish families in the district.

But WHY and HOW did Major Kiesewetter achieve death in The Wheatfield the day before his birthday in 1863? As a business man, Ulric Kiesewetter suffered a gnawing to lay ghost the awesomeness of anglo-saxon mercantile enterprise. Likely, he chose resettlement in the United States rather than Great Britain, because he sensed a more expansive future for his two sons and unmarried daughter. He timed it right: Milwaukee was making its strong move into beer, cheese, lumber, and hardware. So fruitful tumbled the yield, so astute Ulric's husbandry, that Arno was enabled to pass four halcyon years at William and Mary. He graduated magna-cum-laude. The young man came to like _Virginia_ argently: women, horses, and manners. That's WHY... _She_ embraced him at the last.

Arno's mother carried the Viennese maiden-name Lieselotte von Hoffmannsthal. Lieselotte married Ulric on her 16th birthday. She ruled the harpsichord with queenly order. During parturition attendant Berthold Kiesewetter, the mother bled to death. Berthold made it, grace the lactative fitness of an [amah](#Amah) who had been hansomed in from the [Spreewald](#Spreewald) in Brandenburg and put on standby. The doctor had foreseen trouble. It befell... twofold. Berthold [squoze](#Squoze) forth an hunchback. Arno Kiesewetter was 9 years at the time. Obedient to her longing - once the palm-larding rites of moment to Bishop Sebastian von [Falkenblick](#Falkenblick), shepherd to the Koeningsburg Diocese, were undergone - Ulric, Arno, and Magdelena coached with the body to Saint Stefan's Cathedtral at Vienna, whence Lieselotte was buried.

A _Missa Cantata_ was celebrated, with organ and full choir, to the strong harmonies of Mr. Mozart's craftsmanlike Requiem in D-Minor. Arno had never heard _that_ before. He would hear it once again: dead in The Wheatfield, July 2, 1863. That's HOW.

In this sonnet, [quasi ex mortuo](#Quasi Ex Mortuo), he shares with her what both enjoyed most on earth: one another, love-making, music.

>Our place and time to render Death style true.  
>[Also](#Also): She tapped her spile where thighs are crowned.  
>One time I mused to seed a wife, I'd woo  
>But Berthold's camber, daily traced? Sense frowned  
>Daft whim to side. (I _did_ delight back-lanes.)  
>Thou'rt not to scold. Tut, tut yourself. The [Schloss](#Saengerschloss)  
>Was known to rock o'nights, as Ulric's reins  
>Piped calisthenics to bequeath. [Gay moss](#Gay Moss)?  
>Well, same low game, pay high, sew me to three!  
>Thy Magdalen' mourns proud at New Orleans;  
>Her empty surname? Smile, be Savigny.  
>_Alles Kaput_. Last board: Stale bread, eye-beans.  
>No mind, I share the bier [bei Wein](#Bei Wein) tight thee.  
>End chords salve me: His Requiem in D.

### The Gettysburg Sequence #8
#####(The Second Night... July 2, 1863)

Father Corby, Chaplain to the 88th New York Infantry of The Irish Brigade, assesses doings and undoings during the day gone by. Does he echo an apostasy... perhaps Jesus' groan: "Father, Father, why has Thou forsaken me?"

>Mercichill God! Mayos and Clares shrove _thee_  
>At noon. You're safe. [Fitting and fair](#Fitting And Fair)?  'T's on them.  
>Not quite, thou'st yet to squelch accounts with me.  
>Thy bhoy that sported [spiky diadem](#Spikey Diadem),  
>Died at my thumb. _This time_ his name was [Liam](#Liam).  
>What I'd fain know: Whose Pilate's alias?  
>[Parse all she keen](#Parse All She Keen), his widowed dear: erst whim  
>O' bygone bed, now bellied motherness.  
>[Hic est enim calix](#Hic Est Enim Calix)? Piffle, it leaks  
>Roan smudge - morn past, cream Country Kerry lymph.  
>Blessed Lord God of Israel, That tweaks  
>Twin earth-strewn tribes, and coddles [pimp](#Pimp)  
>That no time took Thy name to heart, my harps,  
>Who now bask blue, tuned Lee's Grey how sound sharps.

---------------------------------

### The Gettysburg Sequence #9
#####(The Second Night... July 2, 1863)

Major General John Sedgewick, Cornwall Hollow (later of Hartford), Connecticut, alone in his tent, lapses a moment into boyhood nostalgia. But then a tide of sluggish yankee anger wells within and submerges the extraniety. He chafes at being in reserve with his VI. Corps for the day ahead. A valid reason for the posture General Meade assigned had been the [thirty-two mile forced march](#Thirty-Two Mile Forced March) the Corps underwent to get there at all.

Meade's caution, after standing Lee off, forestalled The Rout. John Sedgewick had to wait upon May 9, 1864 for an appointment that consigned him to the happy fishing stream. The lucky transport agent was a Virginia sharpshooter named John Fell, Quill surmises, at Spotsylvania in The Wilderness. Mr. Bruce Catton deems John Sedgewick "The best loved General Officer in the Union Army."

>We fished you clean, lax [Housatonic](#Housatonic) shoals,  
>Trout-truant kids from dawn till moon snuffed dusk,  
>Then barefoot, soldiered home our casting poles.  
>Meade furrows me, alone t' other bosk.  
>I reck, as brave he bide, beads bind his brow;  
>He copes with larger Lee, come day. Stay Meade,  
>Lord God of Hosts... he'll want your staff this row.  
>And grace he hold, bid him spring mine to mete  
>West-stumbling motley meed. My composed boys --  
>Seed Brattleboro, Braintree, Bath - coil primed  
>To spile the dry. [Last](#Last), [Albanies and Troys](#Albanies And Troys)!  
>Then should Meade fancy flesh, men mine flex timed  
>To butcher, quarter, carve Lee's herding south.  
>Terse troops, John's pride... eloquent for seldom mouth.

Lewis A. Armistead drafts The Order of the Day to Pickett's prized brigade... in time to mound his own cairn.

---------------------------------

### The Gettysburg Sequence #11
#####(The Third Day... July 3, 1863)

Three envoys to [Tophet](#Tophet) emerge the south-east corner Spangler's Wood where it yields to The Swale and the oblique snake fence fronting the Spangler cote. The time stands 16:05 hours. The men need no compass to hold the ENE course the three Brigades have ordained; carnage underfoot delimes the azimuth thrifty enough. And so, this unholy trinity urges on, armed down to the eyelashes.

Lt. Colonel Ian Farquharson, a guest from far away, trifles with his swagger stick and waists a quirky Sikh sabre, for reasons of his own. Surgeon Major Solomon Mendoza shoulders a strapsack, stenciled 26th Michigan: vintage Chancellorsville, no doubt. The receptacle ensconces, brim to the flap, 64 syringes primed with an opiate.

Farquharson, Ian. _aetatis XLVIII_, 5'8", 11 [stone](#Stone) - 8 lb., greying black hair, anthracite eyes. (The last facet belies celtic aboriginality _or_ an iberian dalliance.) He was born at Dunbeath in Caithness. A northman of sorts. His mother came with the maiden name Martha Bethune. When detached for Duty as Observer with The Army of Northern Virginia, he commanded the 2nd Battalian, Black Watch Regiment, provisionally garrisoned at Gibraltar. His calling, and proficiency thereto, scheme all of a piece. In early pubescence, he had swum from Dunnet Head to Duncansby Head on Pentland Firth. The exploit took 6 1/2 days. His older brother and two elder sisters, [Meikle Jamie](#Meikle Jamie), Ruth, Judith striked a [currach](#Currach) beside him to the windward, hulling the needed alimentation and equipage: flint, peat, capes for sleeping, tea, mutton, meal, blouse, philibeg, [skene-dubh](#Skene-Dubh), [sporran](#Sporran). To beach or moor, and then in turn launch, the wee skiff twice each day imposed a seamanship on them more stringent than a natant landfall on Ian himself. More than once, having swum ashore with a tow-line, he snugged it in for them to debark and discharge the cargo. A forbidding landlip, compounded by the tidal deviltry throughout the firth, exacts from the mariner knowing, muscle, and ingenuity. Affording themselves some leeway in respect to tide, floor, and terrain, they came ashore toward mid-day to take food and repose. Then the argosy set out again eastward till the late evening dusk. (Pentland Firth lies at Latitude 50 degrees - 40 minutes). Now fetch land again for a light repast and a deep, though foreshortened, sleep.

Young Farquharson apprenticed at Sandhurst. He had, with time and fact-faceing, much to unlearn of its lore and canon. Remedials abounded at The Punjab and, to lesser measure, in Crimea. The SQUARE wasn't the best contour every time. And _The Thin Red Line_... OCH, and the regimental nightmare - before his day at [New Orleans](#New Orleans). For tactical purposes, he deemed to have fairly well mastered his craft with attendance at Chillianwala, Gujrat, Lahore, and Malakhov. Outside Gujrat, a dismounted Sikh ripped and shattered him, sinew and bone, femur to knee joint. Before he fainted, Capt. Farquharson took time to upend the Sergeant by his beard and turban, and, on the ground, throttled him into [Nirvana](#Nirvana). Spoils too: the sword. Chancellorsville though, shew him an heretofore virginal chapter in his wee, tartan clad manual dealing with agonism-for-keeps.

Mendoza, Solomon: _aetatis XXXVII_, 5'5", 9 stone(#Stone) - 6 lb., flaxen hair, sky-blue eyes. Solomon issued the one-time [Ruth Benjamin](#Ruth Benjamin) at Charleston, South Carolina. He left The Citadel a Bachelor or Arts and a Brevet Lieutenant, Inf. in the State Militia. Two years later he entered The Royal College of Medicine in Trinity, Dublin. Young Mr. Mendoza came out second-in-honours to Merdecai da Sylva of Perth-on-Tay. It was not nepotism that carpeted his trail to the verge of the Emmitsburg Road, July 3, 1863. The Lieutenant had enlisted April 14, 1861. He was stationed Executive Officer, F. Company, 6th South Carolina Regiment. Major Desmond Butler French, G-1 on Gen'l. P. T. G. Beauregard's staff, diddling about routine paperwork, caught the name Mendoza on an amended roster crossing his leisurely work table. It was a quirky wrench of happenchance, as matters sorted. Now, punctilious about his Roman Confession and obeisant his native Gaelic ardour, Des had seeded his bride of seven years four times. Each [gift o' God](#Gift O' God) yawled for the Ceasarian section. The hapless woman entered the nupitals as Breda DeVenney, born Dec. 22, 1832, Merrion Square, Dublin. Still, Bridie and the four lassies beat the book they made it every time. Or was it Dr. Mendoza that had rigged the race? Anyway, within hours the infantry-doctor was breveted Captain S. Mendoza, Medical Detachment, 1st South Carolina Privisional Brigade. No, nepotism never entered the picture. He'd landed his job before [his uncle](#His Uncle) had unctioned his own.

Redmond, Regis Sarsfield: _aetatis XIX_, 5'-6 1/2", 10 [stone](#Stone) - 3 lb., knotty red hair, granite blue eyes. The rogue pupped forth an erstwhile Ruth Schimmelpenninck from York, Pennsylvania. His biological father, Colman Wolfe-Tone Redmond (fiery hair, steel blue eyes) underwnet, with his mount, faggoting this side of hell at The 1st Mannassas. The boys closeness to humankind, since weaning at least, was limited to the precocious and prolonged carnal knowledge of Mrs. Redmond's _bonne de toilette_, a [Masai](#Masai) called Ruthene. She was good. So Regis too had something to fight and live for.

The Doctor, disconcerted by the trickle of walking wounded into his oaken field station, wanted fact first-hand. He [tared](#Tared) palaver, because he know men as well as women - soldiers in particular. Those meadows couldn't lie. He sets out.

The Colonel appoints himself along for the reconnaisance without firepower.

Corporal Redmond is indentured.

It becomes silly to fetch the whole distance to the Codori farm. The morphine, water, and spirits run out a third the way to the Emmitsburg Road. S. Mendoza and R. Redmond, minceing somewhat to skirt the dead and dying retrace purposefully toward the shaded surgery.

Col. Farquharson chooses to linger a while. Something is looking for _him_. By now, [Gehanna's](#Gehanna) vortex men bellow some 1300 yards ENE up the slope at the sill of the last stone wall hard by the copse, in the very maw of Hancock's fire-trap. He turns his back on Hell and idles an easy arc to their point of egress an half hour ago. He bends slightly from the waist, pokeing here and there with the benign, foreshortened [lathee](#Lathee). Then it - _They_ were more precise - finds him. Farquharson goes to one knee, plucks them ever so gently, pand palms into his left hand, Yorickwise, two [orbs](#Orbs). Not musket hard they be. Rather, scrotum pliant and damp. _Their_ Johnny sprawls everywhere about, in motionless ubiquity.

Ian Farquharson has pronounced the marly benison, and now strides with more resolution to rejoin the liveing. _They_ be Solomon Mendoza... this friend, his peer. At just this interval, Major Helmuth von Hebestein of the Royal Prussian Guards, observing with Hancock's II Corps, catches him through field glasses once again, at about 2000 yards through a small clearing on Cemetery Ridge, just to the east of the [Green Mountain Nine-Monthers](#Green Mountain Nine-Monthers) flanking and shredding horribly Armistead's and Kemper's remnants swarming inside Cushing's battery. The Major adumbrates to his colleague, Captain Jeremiah Johnson of Her Majesty's Coldstream Guards, thus: "All the soldiers, north and south, revere him as a talisman. The child that abides in every man, and would seem moribund till Domesday in mercers, magistrates, and monsignori, bubbles out when men are playing Way. One day, a cretin may draw a bead on him; no fighting man would."

On this moment, one does... in grey garb. Chancellorsville has cast its longest shadow. Major Solomon Mendoza, about his work again, keens instanter the senseless thing that has befallen his friend, Ian Farquharson. He despatches Corporal Redmond with an helper to take the action called for. Stretchers aplenty litter the Swale.

Today, the bones dust near Dunbeath in Caithness. Solomon Mendoza has seen to it. These words are enscribed:

Mr. Lincoln, The Commander-In-Chief, despatches an order to Headquarters, army of The Cumberland, outside [Vicksburg](#Vicksburg). It's burthen: Major General Grant, during an indeterminate hiatus, is to tidy debris both banks the Mississippi south to New Orleans, and if there's time, scour the hinterland. But so arrange matters, that he is ready at a moment's notice for summons to Washington.

### The Gettysburg Sequence #14
#####(The Coda... July 13, 1863)

Mrs. Carter, a young widow, gestates. She gropes about her now-very-own mansion outside Culpeper. Sarah Carter divines - as men must decipher - the Civil War that ravishes in the five distinct inferences of that love-hate-love-hate-love word. She stems an upper-class Perthshire hearth; her given name had been Sarah Frazier. As a maiden, she resettled with the family in Boston. There, at Harvard Promenade, she met a senior, Byrd Carter, or Westmoreland County. September the following year, Sarah and Byrd were joined at the Carter's parish church near Kinsale. Byrd's mother was no carving out confectioner's ice. No, she was a woman all right: Sarah Frazier's unforced physical loveliness, bone-build in particular, delighted her. First and foremost, because new blood would be tempering the lineage. So pleased at Byrd's union with Sarah was Mrs. Carter, nee Randolph, that she bestowed on her beloved son, and, to her astute insight, even finer daughter-in-law, the empty lineal mansion and stables at Culpeper.

The lad-to-be, bideing his turn, safe in the loins of Byrd Carter and Sarah Frazier might indeed fulfill the promise. Might. But the harbingers? Another story. _Their_ luck could not hold long. The odds at Gettysburg, in the offing, to keep Brigadier Armistead company the afternoon of July 3, 1863 sorted just too steep.

### Appendix #1
#####FOR GENERAL JOHN BUFORD  
#####(Mid-morning... July 1, 1863)

General John Buford was a fighter, and _he_ swivelled the tactial eye-balls pierceing through which Mr. Lincoln's--the strategist, by now, bar none--decisive vision surveyed. The fragment that follows is excerpted from a base inscription to his bronze statuary on the battlefield. Buford stands there, _dismouted_, (redundancy is, for once, licit) assaying west-south-west along the Chambersburg Pike. Flanking him, rear General John F. [Reynolds](#Reynolds), whose mount is depicted, canonically, in the ominous stance -- [three hooves _terra firma_](#Three Hooves Terra Firma), one cocked for the paw-- hard by on the east and, to the west, by a latter day knicknackery.

The epigram is perhaps not up to Pindaric snuff, still: "... who with the first inspiration of a cavalry officer _selected this battlefield_." (Italics, Quill's).

To temper the ellipsis of the poem a small garland of scattered passages from Mr. Bruce Catton's masterpieces, GLORY ROAD and NEVER CALL RETREAT and Mr. Clifford Dowdey's adamantine DEATH OF A NATION are invoked:

"The light grew, and a dun-colored column of troops came snaking eastward. John Buford had it pegged:..."

"If the Confederates were looking for a fight, Buford was just the man for them. Unsupported cavalry was not expected to stand off infantry, and for a couple of hours or more Buford's two brigades would be entirely unsupported, but Buford liked to fight and he did not propose to leave until somebody made him leave. He dismounted his regiments and spread them along the ridge, one man in every four standing fifty yards in the rear holding horses, the rest squatting behind fences, bushes, trees, or what not and peering at the Rebel skirmishers over their stubby carbines.

"Buford had to keep part of his men patrolling the roads that came down from the north, because the word was that Ewell's troops would be approaching from that direction before long, so his fighting line was a bit skinny."

"There was no very good reason why these Confederates had to get into Gettysburg, except that A.P. Hill was a pugnacious man who liked to fight whenever he got a chance; and there was no especial reason why Yankee cavalry should try to keep them out Gettysburg, except that Buford felt the way Hill felt about fighting. Now Reynolds, a pugnacious as either of these two, looked at the firing lines and heard Buford's situation report: ..." 

"... Reynolds did what was in character for him to do. He was an instinctive inch-by-inch fighter, and now he rode up to the battle line to see that his men struck the blow that he wanted them to strike. As they surged forward a bullet hit him and he toppled from his saddle, dead... and the Battle of Gettysburg had begun, brought on without choice or Lee or Meade by the fact that the roads that crossed here brought together men possessed by a blind, driving urge to fight."

And Mr. Dowdey, from the Confederate perspective: "...The mounted division working out from the Union infantry was commanded by a rough fighter named Buford..."

One may abide the [Mahanian](#Mahanian) stricture. Likely Farragut was the tail that wagged the land-hemmed dog; granted that Salamis consummated what Thermopylae had merely ushered; or, Mountbatten and Nimitz wove victory out such thread the Spitfires and Hurricanes of '40 tended like a vestal wick... And so the terriers hung on for two hours and five minutes, hardby _Willoughby Run_!

>_His_ count sums [relative](#Relative) Leonidas'.  
>Does Doktor Einstein waggle stranger-flag?  
>Time bought's the cue, laconic few to sass  
>[Plumed Persia](#Plumed Persia) teeming Cashtown: stoop, step, crag!  
>The tireless matrix casts bone-true to type:  
>An acre fiefed, an hour bestowing slack  
>Taut friends might truss a loop to fold, then gripe  
>An armour-clad Behemoth till it crack.  
>Foot cavalry? How [insedate](#Insedate) his part,  
>That hasty Pettigrew mistake a check  
>On horseflesh to his ken, for Joab's ark.  
>And thus shew Gettysburg more _field_ than track.  
>[Reynolds](#Reynolds), graced twenty minutes to breath, gleaned well  
>What sliceings Buford' pared, clemming hale hell.

She sums all things to all men, all women... multifarious tissue to several men. Aye, Robert Burns, Quill minds well the _sense_ that under_pins_ your astute and harmonious construal, "NATURE'S LAW". Still, Gettysburg under_mines_ the very piles of animate continuity. Indeed, there _was_ [Flodden](#Flodden), but Bonnie Scotland somehow endured its shambles. (One song, only one, grips Quill tauter than all your masteries - "[FLO'ERS O' THE FOREST](#Flo'ers)"). His homeland? A necropolis since July 4, 1863. So, at the wry mathematic, Gettysburg-by-Willoughby Run supersedes Flodden-by-Coldstream.

### Wordstock

Riddles, sobriquets, foreign or densely dialectal terms, coined words, etc. are keyed by _number_ (#) to their incidence throughout The Sequence. For example, PAWKY, canny, wary, Sc. #3. Now, that simply means that the Scottish word _pawky_ occurs in Sonnet #3 (or its attendant prose) and suggests the foregoing familiar-English meanings.

Routine abbreviations are the established ones found in any good English dictionary. To wit: Sc.=Scottish, Path.=Pathology, Intr.=intransitive use of verb, Heb.=Hebrew, and so forth. A few idiosyncratic signals are employed: Q/M=Quillmint (an homemade locution), or T/Y/M/G=Thank you, Mother Goose, etc.

The import of italics is threefold: (1) Conventionally, to convey emphasis and/or affect the flow of diction. (2) To certify a non-English word -- Hindi, Latin, et al. (Exception: Poem #3, built in unabashed "Borders-Scots" inflection). (3) Pronominally, as in #1, where Mr. Lincoln and Gen'l Lee are evoked contrapuntally. The device delines the one man (Mr. Lincoln) from _the other_ (Gen'l. Lee).

The Wordstock swanks no condescension; Quill avowedly surmises, and _respects_, random gaps in a given reader's encyclopaedic inventory. Moreover, let the stateside person allow that a schooled Scots, Irish, Welsh, or English compeer should not be expected to command scope (Lord Charnwood, Sir Winston Churchill, Lt. Gen'l Sir James Marshall-Cornwall excepted) rangeing over persons, places, and contingencies bearing on the conflict broadly and the Gettysburg holocaust in particualr with the grasp of a middle-aged American, high school trained.

Firstly: Willougby Run/Appomatox: Thermopylae/Salamis.

Secondly: The F. F. V.'s strutted The Cavalier, as sure as John Brown harboured rabies. Quill wrenches a thimble-full of related passages from Mr. Robert Penn Warren's astute, terse Meditations, THE LEGACY OF THE CIVIL WAR. (By bloodlines and early surround, his proclivities must be southern.) His first allusion is to the bent of the South's creative minority: "... the apologists offered a philosphy of marmoreal rigidity, proper to the rigidity of that society." And appositely:

"It did not matter that Theodore Weld, one of the most effective of the Abolitionists, withdrew from active propagandizing because, as he said to an admirer, he found the "he himself needed reforming," and that he "had been laboring to destroy evil in the same spirit as his antagonists." Nor did it matter that Julia Ward Howe, the author-to-be of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," could write in 1858, after a trip to South Carlona: "Moral justice dissents from the habitual sneer, denunciation, and malediction, which have become consecrated forms of piety in speaking of the South." Nor did it matter that Lincoln could take a reasonable tone about John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry: "Old John Brown has been executed for treason against a State. We cannot object, even though he agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong. That cannot excuse violence, bloodshed, and treason. It could avail him nothing that he might think himself right."

"Despite Theodore Weld and Julia Ward Howe and Abraham Lincoln, love of liberty and lust for blood continued to conspire much self scrutiny or meditation on the social effects of inspired rhetoric."

"... And a little later it offered space, too, for the folly of Gevernor Wise and his fellow Virginians, who instead of committing John Brown to an asylum, where all the medical ecidence, even then available to the court, clearly indicated that he should be, hanged him and thereby proved again what is never in much need of proof, that a crazy man is a large-scale menace only in a crazy society." Can the man howling in the mob imagine General R. E. Lee, CSA, shaking hands with Orval Faubus, Governor of Arkansas?"
